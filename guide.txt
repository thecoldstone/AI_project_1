So here we are.

It's a very quick introduction to out Project.

We have these files:

    Basically it is a pipeline of our project (From up to bottom) :

    - main.py (Opens the file)
    - parser.py (Analyzes input from the file)
    - solver.py #Under all search methods

        #FIXME
        - simple.py (It's a simple one iteration search. Looks like greedy.)

        #FIXME
        - bfs.py (It's breadth first search)

        #TODO
        - ... (All other search methods)

    #Utilities that we use in our project. Feel free to add something
    - guard.py (Utilities to find a guard)
    - node.py  (Node is used for tracking search. Used in BFS, ....)
